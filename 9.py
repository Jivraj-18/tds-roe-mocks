World Courier Shortest Path Finder

This script finds the shortest path between two cities using:
1. HTML files for direct flight connections and city coordinates
2. Haversine distance calculation for real-world distances
3. NetworkX Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding

The script:
- Parses city coordinates from city-coordinates.html
- Parses direct flight connections from from-to.html
- Builds a weighted graph with Haversine distances
- Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
